HandBrake encoding automation for Windows

Automatically encodes all the MKV in current folder to MP4 adding subtitles.
For this to work the subtitles should have same name as SRT subtitle and be located in the same folder.


For configuration: 
1. Change C:\Program Files\Handbrake\HandBrakeCLI to HandBrake local directory
2. Change output folder "D:\Downloads\Handbrake\%%G".mp4
